# example-tests
Just a repository of real world example tests where I test drove my SUT code from these tests

A lot of this currently is based off the Hexagonal Architecture & Clean Architecture concepts.  

Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob Martin / 8th Light) see https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html.  You'll see use case interactors, boundary objects (controllers), etc.

more to come...


Note:
* These are tests that are general enough that I can share and don't reveal proprietary information or the implementation of the production code itself OR they might be tests I've done for personal projects as well.
