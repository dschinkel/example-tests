# example-tests
Just a repository of real world example tests where I test drove my SUT code from these tests

A lot of this currently is based off the Hexagonal Architecture & Clean Architecture concepts.  

Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob Martin / 8th Light) see https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html.  You'll see use case interactors, boundary objects (controllers), etc.
